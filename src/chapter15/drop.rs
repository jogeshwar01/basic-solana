// Some cases might require manual cleanup, and the Drop trait provides a way to implement that.
// The Drop trait requires implementing a method called drop that takes a mutable reference to self.
// Example.) using smart pointers to manage locks, threads, and other resources that require cleanup when they go out of scope.
