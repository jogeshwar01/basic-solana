### Concepts

1. Functions
2. Types, Flow Control Statements
3. Standard - Vectors, Maps, Option, Result
4. Ownership and Borrowing
5. Structs, impl, Associated Function vs Methods - static / &self
6. Enums, Option, match and if-let
7. Packages, Crates (Library/Binary) and Modules
8. Collections - Vectors, Strings and Hash Maps
9. Error handling - panic, unwrap, expect, ?, parse
10. Generics, Traits and Lifetimes
11. Tests - assert (eq,ne), panic, cargo test commands, unit/integration tests
12. Minigrep - CLI program - fs module, TDD, env vars, eprintln!
13. Closures (Memoization Pattern, Capture Environment), Iterators (Adaptor and Consumer functions)
14. Crates, Release Profiles (dev/release), Crates.io (Doc Comments, pub use export), Cargo workspaces
15. Smart Pointers - Box, Deref, Drop, Reference Counting, Interior Mutability, Reference Cycles (Weak Pointers)
16. Fearless Concurrency - Threads, Message Passing (Channels - mpsc), Sharing state (Mutex, Arc)
17. Object oriented Programming - Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Trait Objects, State Design Pattern
